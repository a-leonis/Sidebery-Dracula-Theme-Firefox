# Sidebery-Dracula-Theme
Dracula Theme for Sideberry

This is just a simple fork of Gale for FF (https://github.com/mgastonportillo/gale-for-ff) that's been modified for compact mode, with dracula scheme and a slightly modified sidebar. 

- userChrome.css goes into your chrome folder as per usual.

- sidebery.css gets pasted into styles editor in the extension settings.

- Needs compact mode turned on in about:config

- Works with Dracula theme for Fire Fox
